# The Whisker Shogunate

A world-building project for an idle/life-sim game set in **Neko-kuni**, a feudal Japan-inspired world built by and for cats.

## The Concept

Players control isekai'd cats—deceased or abandoned cats from our world who arrive via the Great Torii Gate and build new lives in a society powered by Whisker-Punk technology.

- **Genre**: Idle/life-sim game with deep world-building
- **Setting**: Feudal Japan aesthetic + Ghibli-inspired steampunk
- **Theme**: Second chances, finding purpose, transformation
- **Tone**: Cozy but meaningful, hopeful but grounded

## The Five Provinces

1. **Higashi-hama** (East Shore) - Landing province for newcomers
2. **Kawa-no-kuni** (River Country) - Agricultural heartland
3. **Yama-takumi** (Mountain Forge) - Industrial engineering hub
4. **Mori-shizuka** (Silent Forest) - Spiritual/medical center
5. **Minato-kassei** (Thriving Port) - Trade capital

## Core Theme

> **Becoming yourself is the greatest adventure.**

Every isekai'd cat faces the existential challenge of transitioning from a small, dependent animal to a fully sentient being. The idle game mechanics gain emotional weight because progress = helping your cat find peace, purpose, and identity.
